A spaceship game
1. Level system. there will be multiple levels. for each consecutive level the zone gets shorter, special circles rate increase and decrease (depends on powerup). (700*700 res, gets 50 shorter (x and y axis) each level), 11 levels in total
2. there will be health system for spaceship which stays same no matter level. 
3. multiple Special circles, one with multiple hitpoints, one that increases health, one that negates one missed circle, some will aim for the spaceship, one for powerups, one that progresses level
4. Level progression:  scored based, after reaching a set goal score, level will progress 
5. Powerup keyboard button but with limited counter:, limited bullets that shoots at multiple direction (handle using math.sin/cos(angles)), invincibility 
6. 3 bullet miss on a level causes game over
